# rsrs-cli

The launcher selects the platform binary package and forwards arguments to `rsrs`. Packages include the executable, runtime libraries and notices.

```sh
npm i -g rsrs-cli
# Or: pnpm add -g rsrs-cli
# DEV: npm i -g rsrs-cli@dev
rsrs doctor
rsrs --help
```

`rsrs-cli` is the primary install entry. It depends on the exact same version of
`@rsrsai/cli`, which selects the native platform package. Stable releases use
`latest`; development releases use `dev`.

| Platform | Package |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64, musl (default) | `@rsrsai/linux-x64` |
| Linux x64, glibc | `@rsrsai/linux-x64-gnu` |
| Linux ARM64, musl (default) | `@rsrsai/linux-arm64` |
| Linux ARM64, glibc | `@rsrsai/linux-arm64-gnu` |
| Apple Silicon | `@rsrsai/macos-arm64` |
| Windows x64 | `@rsrsai/win-x64` |
| Windows ARM64 | `@rsrsai/win-arm64` |

Linux ARM64 returns in the DEV channel first. Use `rsrs-cli@dev` for a release
whose manifest includes ARM64; stable versions 1.0.15 and 1.0.16 have no ARM64
packages. A newer stable install becomes applicable only when its release
actually includes those platform packages.

Windows ARM64 is a DEV-first release candidate and requires a version that
actually includes its complete package. Stable 1.0.15 and 1.0.16 omit it.
See the [support matrix](../docs/platform-support.md) for validation status and blockers.

`artifact-manifest.json` defines targets and names. Intel Mac is unsupported.
Linux keeps the static musl package as its default. On a glibc distribution,
select the GNU build explicitly; the same choice applies to npm and pnpm:

```sh
RSRS_LIBC=glibc rsrs doctor
RSRS_LIBC=musl rsrs doctor
# Persist the selection for this shell:
export RSRS_LIBC=glibc
```

The glibc packages require a compatible glibc host; they do not run on Alpine.
If optional packages were omitted during installation, install the selected
platform package at the same version as `@rsrsai/cli`.
See [CLI source](https://github.com/risense-ai/respire-cli) for builds and runtime guides.
